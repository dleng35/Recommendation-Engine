# Recommendation-Engine
(Daniel Leng & Jin Kun Li):

Design a predictive model that uses demographic inputs to determine the set of
software that someone is likely to use for development work, and use that
information to recommend new areas to develop in order to stay current with
technologies. Uses k-means clutering to make recommendations.
